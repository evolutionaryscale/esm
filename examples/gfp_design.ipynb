    "This notebook walks through the computational methods used to design esmGFP in [Hayes et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.01.600583). esmGFP has similar brightness and spectral properties as GFPs found in nature despite being a far distance (58% identity) from known fluorescent proteins, but we also found many other bright new GFPs with similar or higher sequence identity. One can likely design a lot more new GFPs with the approach sketched in this notebook!\n",
